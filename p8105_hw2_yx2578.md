Homework 2

This is my solution to HW2.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

## Problem 1 as demonstrated by Jeff during lecture

First, define a path to the dataset.

``` r
path_to_data = "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx"
```

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
    read_xlsx(
        path = path_to_data,
        sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
        range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
    mutate(
        sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
    )
```

Read precipitation data\! For 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
    relocate(year)
precip_2017 = 
    read_excel(
        "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
        sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
        skip = 1
    ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    drop_na(month) %>% 
    mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
    relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. In the following code
chunk, I create a “helper” tibble that contains pairs of numeric and
character ways of representing month, and then merge that (using month
number as a key) with the precipitation dataset. This technique is one I
use often when I need to recode a moderate or large number of values for
a variable.

``` r
month_df = 
    tibble(
        month = 1:12,
        month_name = month.name
    )
precip_df = 
    bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)
precip_df =
    left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data. In
this dataset:

  - The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8
  - The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

#### Importing, Tidying and description of the NYC Transit data

Import the “NYC\_Transit\_Subway\_Entrance\_And\_Exit\_Data.csv” dataset
in the code chunk below:

``` r
p2_df = 
  read_csv(
    file = "./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select (line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
          route1:route11,  entrance_type, entry, vending, ada) %>%
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, "YES" = 1, "NO" = 0),
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    values_to = "route_name") %>%
  drop_na(route_name) %>%
  select(-name)
```

This dataset contains NYC Transit information. After cleaning and
tidying, it contains the following variables: line, station name,
station latitude, station longitude, routes served, entry, vending,
entrance type, and ADA compliance status. The steps I’ve used to clean
the data so far are:

  - Clean column names
  - Select the columns as required
  - Convert the entry variable from character to a logical variable and
    convert all route variables as character
  - Keep distinct rows only
  - Transform the data into long from, values of route1 to route11
    variables are stored as route\_name, NA values are dropped

After the cleaning and tidying steps above, the cleaned dataset has a
dimension of (1566 rows \* 9 columns).

The raw dataset is not tidy as there are repeated information, and
varialbles used to annotate routes is in the wide form.

#### Answers to Problem 2 question list

  - There are 887 distinct stations in this dataset.
  - There are 252 ADA compliant stations.
  - There are 4 station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance, with a corresponding percentage 0.45%.

#### Route A specific stations:

  - The route number and route name are already distinct when tidying
    the imported data in the process above.
  - There are 56 distinct stations serve the A train. Of these stations,
    16 are ADA compliant.
